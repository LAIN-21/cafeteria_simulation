# Cafeteria Simulation

This is my second simulation and utilizes the same idea as the first one. It is made in python using the simpy package optimizied for simulations. Whats different about this simulation is that is it powered by the use of classes and objects (OOP). The usage of OOP makes for the simulation to be more organized, readable, and elegant. 

It must be said that this is an assignment for University, and that this is the result of team work.

Enjoy!
